Workload Reports Analysis
=========================

This tool is designed to analyse and generate graphs based on collected report
files that count the number of PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) events within
a specific time period.

Please note that the script is not considered finished and may require modifications
to suit your specific needs.

The script expects the collected information to be stored in a designated
folder, which can be specified using the provided flags. This is particularly
useful when multiple report scripts are used together for a comprehensive
analysis. The tool distinguishes between the unoptimized version and the
optimized (modified) version of the workload.

To obtain more information about the tool and its usage, run the
command *graphs.py -h*.
